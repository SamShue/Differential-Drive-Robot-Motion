# Differential-Drive-Robot-Motion
A guide to understanding differentrial drive kinematics and a MATLAB Script for simulating a simple wheeled mobile robot in a 2D environment and exploring kinematic models used for dead reckoning position tracking.

## MATLAB Code Demo
The project code demonstrates the two models mentioned above with a very simple robot simulation. To run the code, simply clone this repository and run the script SIMULATION_RobotMotion.m. This code will drive a simulated robot along a sinusoidal path using the ICR model by default.
